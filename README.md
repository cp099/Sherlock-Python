**Sherlock is a comprehensive, self-hosted inventory and lending management system designed for school labs, makerspaces, and workshops.**

This project is a complete, ground-up rewrite and significant feature expansion of the original [Sherlock v1.0](https://github.com/Atal-Lab-DPSBS/Sherlock). It transforms the application from a simple inventory list into a powerful, data-driven lab management platform built on a modern and robust Python/Django backend.

## üåü Mission

The goal of Sherlock v2.0 is to provide a powerful, easy-to-deploy, and intuitive tool for lab managers to track their physical inventory. It answers the critical questions of lab management:
*   **What** do we have and **where** is it?
*   **Who** has borrowed our equipment?
*   **When** is it due back?
*   **What** is our inventory's lifecycle?

## ‚ú® Core Features

### Inventory Management
*   **Hierarchical Structure:** Organize your inventory logically with **Sections**, **Spaces**, and **Items**.
*   **Stock Control:** A full, permanent audit trail for every stock change (e.g., "Received New Stock," "Reported Damaged").
*   **Label Printing:** Generate and print custom barcode and QR code labels to seamlessly bridge your physical and digital inventory.
*   **Unified Search:** A powerful, live-search dashboard to find any item or student record in the system.

### Advanced Lending System
*   **Student Records:** Maintain a secure database of students with filtering and search capabilities.
*   **Kiosk-Style Checkout Terminal:** A dedicated, fast interface for lending items, featuring a live, as-you-type search for both students and items.
*   **Stock Validation:** The system automatically checks available stock before allowing a checkout.
*   **Partial Returns & Loan History:** A sophisticated check-in system that allows for partial returns and keeps a complete, auditable log of every transaction for both students and items.
*   **Due Date & Overdue Tracking:** Assign a due date to every loan and get instant visibility on overdue items through the main dashboard and a dedicated report.

### Modern Technology
*   **Camera Scanning:** Use your device's camera for rapid checkouts and to instantly look up any item, space, or section with the Universal Scan tool.
*   **Data Visualizations:** The main dashboard features charts for weekly loan activity and most popular items, providing instant insight into your lab's operations.
